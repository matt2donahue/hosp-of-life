# hosp-of-life
This project was done in the group for the purpose of implementing a Red-Black Tree.
I was personally responsible for the backend development of this project, and used my own implementation of the tree.
The rest of the coding was done by other group members.
The tree was used to organize hospital patients for easy and efficient lookup and data retrieval.
